Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am Pratham and I am a Linux Engineer at OnMobile Global. I have a passion for technology and have gained a diverse set of skills through self-hosting various projects over the past 2 years.
Skills

    Linux
    AWS
    Networking
    Virtualization

Projects

I have worked on various self-hosted projects, including:

    AllSafe Password Manager: Built on VB.net framework with MySQL database in the backend. The main motive was to develop an application that helps to secure users' passwords by generating new passwords of strings containing random characters, that cannot be cracked by a wordlist and social engineered.
    Akounced Accounting: A multi-user web-based accounting system that replaces traditional accounting systems, allowing users to access it from anywhere in the world. Built to a docker image using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, Akounced Accounting provides a simple, user-friendly interface with easy deployment for managing user access, financial transactions and generating reports.
